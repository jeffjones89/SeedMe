# SeedMe

Welcome to SeedMe, an app designed for entrepreneurs to share information about their companies and collaborate with each other in an online community.

The app was developed using Rails 4.2.3. All gems included in Gemfile. To access the development environment, simply run a bundle install and create/migrate/seed the database. A production version is live on Heroku, linked from this repository.

Next steps involve adding further user functionality such as threaded messaging, an investor portal and updating the styling. Please feel free to issue pull requests for any functionality or improvements that you see fit.
